**What is Docker**

-   Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy,
and run applications by using containers.

-   It is bit like Virtual Machine

-   Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of
the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship
it all out as one package.

-   Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy,
and run applications with containers.

-   The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is
called containerization.

-   Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications
is.

-   Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

-   Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
-   Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
-   Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
-   Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and
    run anywhere.
-   Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute
    container replicas.
-   Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

**container**
-   it is a runtime instance of an image--what the image
becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user
process). You can see a list of your running containers with the
command.




**Postgres Sql :**

-   PostgreSQL is open source object-relational database system
that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that
safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

**Why Postgres**

-   you can define your own data types, build out custom functions, even
write code from  without recompiling your database!
