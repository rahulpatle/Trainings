**Orient DB**	

**Reviews**

1) The Orient DB is the world’s fastest graph database 10x faster than Neo4j on graph operations among all the workloads, we see in Neo4j lag behind if we compare all workloads scenario like update/insert operations and read operations.
2) It provide power of graphs with document, key/value, reactive, object-oriented, and geospatial models into a single scalable, high-performance operational database.
3) Orient DB Community Version is  Open source , uses Apache-2 licence which is i think good for learner as well as professional to use in company.
4) The relationships are managed as in graph databases with direct connections between records which means extraction of data will much faster than traditional db.
5) Also It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes.
6) We can run it anywhere as this is implemented using pure Java.
 
 Security features are good 
 - Authenticators
 - password validations
 - LDAP import of database roles and users
 - advanced auditing capabilities
 - syslog support

**Security Aspects**
1) When it comes to database encryption, starting with version 2.2, OrientDB can encrypt records on disk which prevents unauthorized users from accessing database content or even from bypassing OrientDB security.
2) Most NoSQL products are still used to enable applications built on relational DBMSs to scale.Relationships are physical links to the records; there’s no need for joins.

**For Integration :**
- OrientDB is an Enterprise class DBMS able to talk with almost any existent technology and is equipped with its own JDBC Drivers to allow any 3rd party tool to access to an OrientDB database.
 

**For Cloud Operation :** 
- It Supports AWS/Microsoft Azure  as a cloud providers.

**Technology Aspects :**
**NoSQL**
- RDBMSs are schema oriented which means that data stored in them needs to be structured and with database rules but NoSQL databases can process unstructured data like  videos, pictures, audio files etc.

**Graph Database** 
- Graph databases are NoSQL databases having graph data model where vertices, which is an entity such as a person, place, object  and edges, which represent the relationship between two nodes.
- Graph databases are particularly helpful because they highlight the links and relationships between relevant data similarly to how we do so ourselves.

**Multi-Model DB**
- combines the power of graphs with document, key/value, reactive, object-oriented, and geospatial models into a single scalable, high-performance operational database.
